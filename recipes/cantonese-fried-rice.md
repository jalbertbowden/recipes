# Cantonese Fried Rice  

## INGREDIENTS

    4 cups cooked rice, cooled (preferably cooked the day before)
    Vegetable oil
    2 eggs
    ¼ cup raw shrimps, diced
    1 thick (¼ inch/5 mm) slice raw ham
    2 green onions, sliced thinly
    ¼ cup carrots, diced
    ¼ cup Chinese mushrooms, diced
    ¼ cup cooked chicken, diced
    ¼ cup bamboo shoots, diced
    ¼ cup green peas
    Light Chinese soya sauce
    Salt and white pepper

## Method  
    Using your hands, separate cooked rice to keep grains from sticking together.

    In a large dish, place all ingredients.

    Heat wok for a few minutes. Add a little oil, making sure to cover the sides. Pour in beaten eggs. Stir well to make a small omelet.

    In a dish, set the omelet aside.

    Add a little more oil and prepare to cook ingredients. Add the raw ingredients one at a time in the following order: carrots, shrimps, mushrooms, ham and green onions. Stir well and allow to cook for a maximum of two minutes before each new addition.

    Add rice, stirring until nicely dried and heated through.

    Add cooked ingredients - chicken, bamboo shoots, omelet, and green peas. Cook for one minute, combining all ingredients thoroughly.

    Add a few spoonfuls soya sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste.

    Stir through and serve.

## Ingredients
| Amount | Ingredient                    |
| ------ | ----------------------------- |
| 8      | slices Texas Toast            |
| 4      | large eggs                    |
| 3/4    | cup milk                      |
| 1      | teaspoon pure vanilla extract |
| Pinch  | of salt                       |
| 2      | tablespoons granulated sugar  |
| 1 ½    | teaspoons ground cinnamon     |
| Dab    | Butter for the pan            |

## Instructions  
1. Beat eggs, milk, vanilla, and salt very well in a medium mixing bowl or a large measuring cup. Beat until appearance is uniform with no visible egg pieces showing. Pour into a shallow bowl that's big enough to dip a piece of bread into.
2. In a small bowl, mix together sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle each side of the bread evenly with cinnamon sugar mixture.
3. Heat a flat skillet or griddle over medium heat. Place butter on pan for more flavor, to encourage a golden brown color, and to prevent French toast from sticking to the pan.
4. Dip a piece of bread into the egg mixture and let it soak up egg and milk mixture for 10-15 seconds on each side. Let excess egg mixture drip off before placing French toast on heated griddle.
5. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side or until golden brown and cooked through.

## Notes  
Nutritional information does not include butter for the pan or toppings.

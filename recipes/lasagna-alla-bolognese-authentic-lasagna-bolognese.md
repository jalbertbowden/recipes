# Lasagna Bolognese (Lasagne alla Bolognese)  

Authentic Italian Lasagna Bolognese (Lasagne alla Bolognese) made with the most incredible and flavourful Bolognese Ragu, creamy bechamel sauce and layers of fresh spinach pasta. Note: Unless you have a lot of time I recommend making the ragu and pasta dough the day before which makes the assembly of the lasagna much easier.

## Instructions
To make the Bolognese Ragu (recommended the day before)
Finely chop the carrot, celery, onion and cut the pancetta into small cubes.
Heat the olive oil in a large pot and add the vegetables and pancetta, saute until the vegetables have softened but are not browned (5-10 minutes).
Next, add the beef and cook until browned. Add the white wine and cook for another 1-2 minutes.
Add the passata (tomato puree) and stock and stir to combine. Cover the pot and simmer slowly for 2 hours.
After 2 hours uncover and add the milk. Simmer the sauce uncovered for another 2 hours. After cooking, taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper as needed.
If making the day before, once completely cool, transfer the ragu to a large bowl and refrigerate.


To make the spinach pasta (recommended the day before)
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and wilt the spinach for 30-60 seconds. Drain in a colander and rinse under cold water until completely cold. Squeeze out as much liquid as possible (the spinach shouldn’t have excess water).
Put the spinach and eggs (2 whole eggs and 1 yolk) in a blender and blitz to a smooth puree.
Add the flour to a large mixing bowl or clean work surface and make a well in the middle. Add the spinach puree and start to incorporate it into the flour using a fork.
Once a rough dough has started to form, tip it onto your work surface and bring it together. Knead the dough for 10 minutes until smooth. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Remove it from the fridge 30 minutes before using.
Make the bechamel sauce
Melt the butter in a medium-sized saucepan then add the flour. Whisk to a paste and let it cook for about 1 minute.
Whisk in the milk in 4 intervals allowing the sauce to thicken between each addition, add the nutmeg and season with salt and pepper. Continue to stir the sauce until it’s thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon (you should be able to draw a line on the back of the spoon and it holds its shape).
Once thickened turn off the heat and set aside (don’t worry if your bechamel gets a skin on the top while you are doing other things just give it a vigorous whisk for a few seconds).
Prepare the pasta (when ready to bake the lasagna)
Remove your pasta from the fridge 30 minutes before using.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it well.
Set up your pasta machine and set it to the widest setting (usually number 0). Cut your dough in half keeping one half wrapped in plastic wrap.
Flatten the other half so it’s easier to pass through your pasta machine and pass it through the widest setting. Fold one end of the dough to the middle and the other end right over that as if you were creating a leaflet. Flatten the dough and pass it through the widest setting again. Repeat this one more time.
Next, roll your dough once through each setting up until the 3rd last number (usually number 7). You may need to lightly dust the pasta dough, surface and pasta machine with flour if it feels too sticky.
Cut the pasta in sheets big enough to fit your lasagna dish. Blanch them in the boiling water (about 2 or 3 at a time) for 1 minute then transfer them to a clean kitchen towel. Let them dry out for a few seconds.
Repeat this whole process with the second half of dough. Tip: I find it easier to start assembling the lasagna with half of the prepared pasta before rolling out the rest.



Assemble and bake the lasagna
Pre-heat the oven to 200C (400F).
Spread a small spoonful of ragu on the bottom of your lasagna dish. It should be spread sparingly this is mainly to stop the pasta from sticking to the bottom of the dish (see photos or video).
Lay one layer of blanched lasagna sheets in the bottom of the dish, cutting them to size if needed so there isn’t a big overlap of pasta.
Next, spread over a large spoonful of ragu, a ladelful of bechamel then grate a layer of Parmigiano Reggiano. Add another layer of pasta sheets and continue the same process until you’ve used up all the ingredients (you want at least 6 layers of pasta). Make sure to finish with a layer of ragu, bechamel and cheese.
Bake in the oven for 30 minutes or until golden brown on top. Let the lasagna sit for 10 minutes before serving.

## Notes
Lasagna Sheets - if you don’t have time to make homemade pasta I recommend using store-bought fresh lasagna sheets (those stored in the fridge and not dried). Fresh lasagna sheets do not need par-boiled first.
Rolling out pasta - if you find the pasta is a little sticky or tacky when rolling it out you can lightly dust the pasta, your work surface and pasta machine with flour but try to add as little as possible.
Par-boil the pasta (if homemade) - spinach pasta has more moisture in it than regular egg pasta dough so it's important to par-boil or blanch the pasta before layering into the lasagna or it'll be too soft and mushy. Blanching it first helps create a stronger barrier between each layer.
Using a kitchen scale - if you plan on making homemade pasta I highly recommend weighing the flour with a scale as cups can vary dramatically depending on who measures it, the method they use and the brand of flour. When measuring cups for our recipes I always spoon the flour into the cup and level it off with a knife so make sure to use this method if using cups.
Leftovers - cooked lasagna will keep in the fridge for 2-3 days and can be reheated in a pre-heated 200C (400F) oven until piping hot throughout.
Freezing - you can freeze the lasagna before or after cooking (I recommend before) in one big freezer-proof dish or individual portions for up to 1 month. Cook straight from frozen in a pre-heated 200C (400F) oven until piping hot throughout. I recommend freezing in foil trays to cook from frozen (do not cook glass or ceramic dishes straight from frozen).

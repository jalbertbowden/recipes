# Perfectly Creamy Mashed Potatoes


Ingredients
  
1x
2x
3x
8 large Russet Potatoes
½ cup butter
¾ cup heavy cream
½ cup milk
salt & pepper to taste
Instructions
 
Peel and cut potatoes into small cubes, place in large bowl. Rinse the potatoes in cold water a few times to rinse off the starch.
Fill the bowl with cold water to cover the potatoes with at least an inch of water. Refrigerate the potatoes soaking in water for at least 4 hours, up to overnight.
When ready to book, rinse the potatoes once more. Transfer the potatoes to a large pot, cover the potatoes with at least 2 inches of water. Transfer the pot to the stove and bring the water to a boil, boil for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are fork tender.
Drain the potatoes from the water in a colander. Leave the potatoes in the colander for a few minutes.
In the same large pot that you boiled the potatoes, heat butter, heavy cream and milk on medium high heat. Add salt and pepper to the melted butter and cream mixture.
Either run the potatoes through a ricer or food mill straight into the melted butter and cream mixture or mash the potatoes right into mixture. Gently fold the potatoes into the mixture until fully combined. Taste for salt and pepper, serve warm.

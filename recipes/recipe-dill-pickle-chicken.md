# Dill Pickle Chicken  

## INGREDIENTS  
1.5 lbs thinly sliced chicken breasts  
1 1/2 cup dill pickle juice  
2 large eggs, beaten  
1 tablespoon milk  
3/4 cup seasoned breadcrumbs  
3/4 cup seasoned panko bread crumbs  
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and black pepper, to taste  
olive oil cooking spray, optional  

## Instructions  

Place chicken and dill pickle juice in a ziplock bag. Remove as much air as possible and move chicken around to coat in pickle juice. Marinate in the refrigerator for 8 to 12 hours.  
After marinating, remove chicken from pickle juice and dry the chicken on paper towels. Discard any leftover pickle juice. 
Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or place a wire cooling rack on a rimmed baking pan for crispier all around chicken.  
Whisk together eggs and milk in a medium sized bowl. In a large shallow bowl, combine breadcrumbs, panko bread crumbs, salt and pepper.  
Dip chicken breasts in the egg mixture, then into the breadcrumb mixture and shake off any excess.  
Place the chicken onto the prepared baking sheet and spray both sides with olive oil cooking spray.  
Bake for 10 minutes and then flip and continue to bake for approximately 8 minutes more. You want your chicken to be golden brown and cooked through with an internal temperature of 165°F.  

## Notes    
You can use any kind of pickle juice you have on hand. I also tested this recipe with juice leftover from spicy pickles and bread and butter pickle juice. Both were delicious!

## Ingredients
▢1 ½ cups arborio rice (290g)
▢2 shallots finely chopped
▢~ 1 tsp saffron (0.3g)
▢½ cup white wine (125m)
▢3 ¼ cups chicken stock good quality (800ml)
▢2 tablespoon Parmesan freshly grated
▢1 tablespoon olive oil
▢Salt and pepper to season

## Instructions
Keep the chicken stock warm in a saucepan and get a ladle ready
Add olive oil to a large pan/skillet on a low-medium heat then add the chopped shallots. Saute the shallots until translucent but not browned.
Add the rice and stir to coat the grains in the oils then add the wine. Simmer for 2 minutes then add 1 ladleful of chicken stock.
Let the rice absorb the chicken stock whilst constantly stirring when it’s almost absorbed all of it add another ladle of stock, continue with the same process.
When you only have only 2 ladlefuls of stock left add the saffron then continue until all the stock is gone. As you stir the saffron will get deeper in colour. Season with a generous pinch of salt and add the parmesan. Taste for seasoning then serve.

Notes
Slowly cook the shallots so they don't burn (it'll affect the flavour of the whole dish) they don't take long!
Don't add the saffron too early as it'll start to lose its flavour.
You can add more or less saffron to your liking but remember to not add too much as it can be overpowering to most people.
The yellow colour will deepen as the risotto cooks so wait a few minutes before adding more if you are looking a deep yellow colour.
Use high-quality chicken or vegetable stock, I like to use homemade when possible (store it in the freezer for making dishes like this) or use ready-made quality stock you can buy in tubs or pouches before reaching for cubes.* See more info in the post above.
Risotto tends to need a lot more salt than you think so always taste it throughout. Remember that the brand or variety of stock you use will make a difference some have more seasoning than others so always check before adding more.
Leftovers can be stored in the fridge for 1-2 days or frozen in suitable containers.

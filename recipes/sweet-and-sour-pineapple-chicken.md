# Sweet and Sour Pineapple Chicken  

## Ingredients  

    1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thigh meat
    ½ cup corn starch
    Oil for frying
    1 clove garlic, minced
    1 inch ginger, minced
    1 white onion, peeled and chopped in 1 incn pieces
    1 red bell pepper, chopped in 1 incn pieces
    1 yellow bell pepper, chopped in 1 incn pieces
    ½ pineapple, cubed, or 1 can pineapple chunks

## Marinade  

    1 egg white
    1 Tbsp rice wine or mirin
    ½ tsp salt
    ½ tsp white pepper, ground

## Sauce  

    ¼ cup stock or water
    3 Tbsp rice wine
    3 Tbsp ketchup
    2 Tbsp sugar
    1 Tbsp rice vinegar
    3 tsp corn starch

## Method

    Cut chicken into 1-inch cubes and place in a bowl.

    Mix all marinade ingredients together and pour on top of chicken. Mix and marinate 30-60 minutes.

    Meanwhile, stir all sauce ingredients together.

    Add at least 2 inches of oil to a wok or thick pot on high heat.

    Place corn starch in a large bowl and dredge marinated chicken pieces. Be sure to coat chicken evenly.

    When oil is hot, deep fry chicken pieces until crispy and lightly browned, about 4 minutes for each batch (there should be 2 or 3 batches). Place on a plate lined with paper towels and set aside.

    Discard frying oil, leaving about 3 tablespoons in the wok. If there is any corn starch in the oil, discard it all and start with 3 new tablespoons of oil.

    When oil is hot, add garlic and ginger and fry for 30 seconds. Add onions and bell pepper and stir fry until starting to soften, 4-5 minutes.

    Add pineapple chunks and mix well. If using canned pineapple, drain it first, reserving some of the juice to add to the sauce.

    Stir the sauce ingredients again, ensuring the corn starch is incorporated. Add sauce ingredients to the pot and stir well.

    Taste sauce and adjust seasoning if necessary. When sauce begins to boil and thicken, add the fried chicken pieces.

    Mix well and simmer for another 30 seconds to 1 minute.

    Serve with white rice.

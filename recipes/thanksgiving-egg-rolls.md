Yields: 12
Prep Time: 0 hours 10 mins
Total Time: 0 hours 30 mins

## Ingredients
6 Eggroll wrappers
1 c. leftover turkey, shredded
1 c. leftover mashed potatoes
1 c. Leftover cranberries
1 c. leftover stuffing
vegetable oil
1/3 c. Leftover gravy, for dipping

## Directions

Place an egg roll wrapper on a clean surface in a diamond shape and spread a thin layer of cranberries. Next add a couple tablespoons of mashed potatoes, then stuffing, and then turkey. Fold up bottom half and tightly fold in sides. Gently roll, then seal fold with a couple drops of water. Repeat with remaining leftovers.  
In a large skillet over medium heat, heat remaining oil (it should reach 1" up the side of pan) until it starts to bubble. Add egg rolls and fry until golden, 1 minute per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to cool slightly.  
Serve with heated gravy.
